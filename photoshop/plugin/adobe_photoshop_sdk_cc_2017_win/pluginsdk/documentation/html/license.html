The provisions of this section 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, howsoever caused, but this shall not imply or create any continued right to Use the Software after termination of this Agreement.

 IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. ADOBE'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Adobe's liability to you in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Adobe's negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose. For further information, please contact Adobe's Customer Support Department. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or special damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.</li><li>INDEMNIFICATION <br>
 Developer agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Adobe from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys' reasonable fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of Developer Programs containing the Sample Code, provided that Adobe gives Developer prompt written notice of any such claim, tenders to Developer the defense or settlement of such a claim at Developer's expense, and cooperates with Developer, at Developer's expense, in defending or settling such claim.</li><li>GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS <br>
