Systems Software - software that provides services that are commonly useful, including operating systems, compilers, loaders, and assemblers. 

Huh. I did not know that compilers are systems software, 
I also do not know what a loader is, 
I'm guessing this like a linker?
The thing that loads the dlls and dylib files. 

Every computer system has a operating system and a compiler. 
An operating system interfaces between a users program and the hardware and provides a variety of services and supervisory functions. 

The most important functions of an operating system are: 

- io operations
- allocating storage and memory
- providing for protected sharing of the computer among multiple applications using it simultaneously

Operating systems serves the application software,

Assembly language is that simple stuff that just does arithmetic operations and memory jumps and stuff, 

assembly lang is translated into 101010101 binary digit streams ie. 'machine language'
