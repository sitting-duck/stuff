"civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them."
-Alfred North Whitehead, An Introduction to Mathematics, 1911

computers led to a third revolution, the information revolution, after the agricultural and industrial revolutions.

### The 3 Classes of Computers
1. Personal computers
2. Servers
3. embedded computers

Embedded computers are in your TV, and your washer and dryer. 
Personal computers are like your laptop and desktop
servers exist inside a networks

servers are the modern form of what were once much larger comptuers and are usually only accessed via a network. 
oriented to carry sizable workloads, 
single complex applications, or many small jobs such as in a large web server, 

embdedded applications opten have unique application requirements that combine a minm performance with stringent limitations on cost or power. For example, consider a music play: the processor need only be as fast as necessary to handle its limited function and beyond that, minimizing cost and and power is all that matters. 

Despite their low cost, embedded computers ofen have lower tolerance for failure, since the result of a car crash for example is a lot worse than having to reboot your computers. 

In home appliances, dependability is usually acheived through simplicity, the empasis on doing one function as perfectly as possible. 

In large embedded systems techniques of redundancy from the serverworld are often employed. 
Although this book focuses on general purpose computers, most concepts apply directly, or with slight modifications to embedded computers. 

### Processor Cores
Many embedded processors are designed using processor cores, a version of a processor written in a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL
The core allows a designer to integrate other application specific hardware with the processor core for fabrication on a single chip. 

Taking over form the conventional server is cloud computing, which relies upon giant datacenters that are now known as <b>Warehouse Scale Computers</b>
(WSCs). Companies like Amazon and Google build these WSCs con

The integrated circuit is what made the computer revolution possible. 

### Size Ambiguity

kb has a decimal and a binary term for what we mean when we say kilobyte, they are not actually the same exact size, but close enough for engineering

KB == 10^3 == 2^10 the binary representation is 2% larger than the base 10 one

the amount of error goes up with orders of magnitude, so a yottabyte has it so that the binary one is a whopping 21% larger, a much larger error!!
